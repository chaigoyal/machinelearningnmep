    "Go back and review your slides/notes on SVD. Also, feel free to ask around. In short, an SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) of a matrix is a low-rank approximation of that matrix. What does this mean? Suppose the original matrix was of rank $R$, and we are trying to reduce it to rank $K$. SVD is the result of taking this list of $R$ unique vectors and approximating them as a linear combination of $K$ unique vectors."

    "Another way to think about this is geometrically - in SVD: $$ A \\approx U \\Sigma V^{T} $$ Suppose we multiply a vector $z$ with $A$. $$ A v \\approx U \\Sigma V^{T} z$$ We can think of this as a 3-step process: first, $V^{T}$ hits $z$ and *rotates* it into its eigenbasis (don't worry if you don't know what that is - all you should get out is that this first step is a rotation. Remember, $U$ and $V$ are orthonormal, so they don't change the magnitude of $z$, they only rotate). Then in step 2, $\\Sigma$ hits $z$ and stretches it along the principal axes - remember, $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix, so what's happening here is that each element of the newly rotated $z$ is being scaled by a certain amount, the singular values. Finally in step 3, $U$ hits $z$ and rotates back into $z$'s *original* basis. Here's a visual of this whole process:"

Proper cross validation would solve this issue."
